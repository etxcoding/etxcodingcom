There is a problem with Parallelshell that has to be fixed manually, go to the file:
node_modules/parallelshell/index.js
Then change this line:
cwd: process.versions.node < '8.0.0' ? process.cwd : process.cwd(),
To this:
cwd: parseInt(process.versions.node) < 8 ? process.cwd : process.cwd(),
It's done!

There is another problem when trying to run gulp command for example, error sasys something about:
cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system

To solve this, run the next command: 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
